## In a Nutshell

**A.)** You simply can't account for every type of device that users will be using when they visit your website.

**B.)** Not all content is suited for all devices

**C.)** Not all devices are suited for all content

A width-based approach can be much more flexible *and user friendly* - **not to mention much easier to manage**

Some Common Breakpoints *as used within Bootstrap 3*

* Large Desktop ≥ 1200px
* * Medium Desktop ≥ 992px
* * Small (Tablets) ≥ 768px
* * X-Small (Mobile) < 768px

* ## The Code
*
* A grossly oversimplified take on media queries
*
*     @media only screen and (min-width: 1170px) and (max-width: 1189px) {
*             // The Code!...
*                 }
*                     
*                     *Replacing the min-width and max-width properties above as needed per each desired breakpoint*
*
*                     **What can we accomplish with these media queries you speak of?**
*
*                     * Hide/Show various segments of content
*                     * Resize text
*                     * Utilize a [Magic Grid System](http://getbootstrap.com/) to make our layout perform wonderous tasks!
*
*                     ## More to come...
*
*                     **TODO**
*
*                     * Write TODO list...
